To run just open client and server directory (which are present in src) in seperate terminal. 
Firstly run server.py by "python server.py" command in the first terminal
Then run client.py by "python client.py" command in the second terminal.
Since rest of the commands are implemented as the same as expected by assignment. One can follow assignment-1 question 1 to know about each of the command
You are ready go. 
PS the code requires python3
